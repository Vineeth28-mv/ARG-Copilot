Design a comprehensive 12-month surveillance study to monitor antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) dynamics in hospital wastewater.

Study Context:
- Location: Large urban teaching hospital (500+ beds)
- Goal: Track ARG prevalence and abundance across different treatment stages
- Special interest: Correlate ARG patterns with antibiotic usage data
- Budget: Moderate (university-funded pilot study)

Specific Questions:
1. What sampling frequency and duration would capture seasonal variation?
2. Which sampling points (influent, activated sludge, effluent) are most informative?
3. What metadata should we collect (temperature, pH, chemical analysis)?
4. What wet-lab protocols are appropriate for low-biomass wastewater samples?
5. What bioinformatics pipeline would you recommend for ARG quantification?
6. What statistical analyses should we use to compare treatment stages?

Constraints:
- Need to minimize costs while maintaining statistical power
- Must comply with biosafety regulations for clinical wastewater
- Limited on-site laboratory facilities (samples will be transported)
